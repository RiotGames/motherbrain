      # Run a bootstrap on each of the hosts given to this instance of {Worker}. There are two different kinds of
      # bootstrap processes which may be run on a node; a partial bootstrap and a full bootstrap.
      #
      # Partial Bootstrap: a node will be partially bootstrapped if it has
      #   1. Chef installed by omnibus
      #   2. Ruby installed by omnibus
      #   3. A Chef client registered with the Chef server.
      #      note: the name of the client is the "node_name" of the node. This obtained by running the
      #            ruby node name script "script/node_name.rb" on the node.
      #
      # Full Bootstrap: a node will be fully bootstrapped if it does not satisfy all of the criteria for a
      #   partial bootstrap.
      #
      # @example
      #   worker = Worker.new
      #   worker.run("cloud-1.riotgames.com") #=> {
      #     node: "cloud-1.riotgames.com",

      #     message: "",
      #     bootstrap_type: :full
      #   }
      #
      # @param [String] address
      #   a hostname or ipaddress to bootstrap
      #
      # @option options [String] :environment
      #   environment to join the node to (default: '_default')
      # @option options [Hash] :attributes (Hash.new)
