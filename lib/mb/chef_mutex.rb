  # @author Justin Campbell <justin@justincampbell.me>

  #
  # Allows for MotherBrain clients to lock a chef resource. A mutex is created
  # with a name. Sending #lock to the mutex will then store a data bag item
  # with mutex name, the requestor's client_name, and the current time.
  # An attempt to lock an already-locked name will fail if the lock
  # is owner by someone else, or succeed if the lock is owned by the current
  # user.
  #
  # @example Creating a mutex and obtaining a lock
  #
  #   mutex = ChefMutex.new("my_resource")
  #
  #   mutex.lock # => true
  #   # do stuff
  #   mutex.unlock # => true
  #
  # @example Running a block within an obtained lock
  #
  #   mutex = ChefMutex.new("my_resource")
  #
  #   mutex.synchronize do
  #     # do stuff
  #   end
